<h3>TNGenWeb Sample Projects</h3>
<h4>Project 1: Decatur County Marriage Certificates</h4>


<div ><strong>Rationale</strong>: Marriage records can provide valuable information of great use to genealogists. This &quot;test&quot; project proposes to make original images of marriage records available online for volunteers to index.<div>
<br></div>
<div><strong>Images</strong>: I am attaching 5 marriage certificates from Decatur County, Tennessee.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><strong>Fields to index</strong>:</div>
<div><ul style><li style><strong>County</strong> - in this case it would be Decatur</li>
<li style><strong>Names</strong> (so we can index all the names appearing on a document) - I&#39;m guessing you&#39;d have repeatable fields somehow for names - one to
 many relationship? As for format, I don&#39;t think we have a preference for whether the first name, middle name, surname should be split into different fields, but I would guess for names you&#39;d probably split? If not, we could do &quot;LastName, FirstName MiddleName&quot; into one field for data entry. If it were possible to label each name (e.g. Bride, Groom, Witness, etc.) that would be cool, but it would probably be to granular for your overall purposes?</li>
<li style><strong>Date</strong> - so we can capture the date of the record. I&#39;d be interested in having the day, month and year in different fields. When it 
comes to marriage records, there could potentially be multiple dates - date bond issued, date of return.</li>
</ul>
<div >When fully indexed, we would use something like this to have as a database for our researchers. The ability to search and browse would be great. And, we would likely want the ability to download the data itself so we could have a copy, if the idea was that the information would be hosted on a central server</div>
