      <p><i>Did you watch the volunteers indexing the 1940 Census and wish you could run a project like that on the records you care about?  Then read on...</i></p> 
        <h2>The Documents</h2>

<p>Many documents are more usefully digitized into searchable databases than into text editions.  These include</p>

<ul>
<li>Muster rolls<br>
</li>
<li>Account books<br>
</li>
<li>Tax lists</li>
<li>Obituary clippings</li>
<li>Census forms</li>
<li>Wills</li>
<li>Church registers</li>
<li>Manumissions</li>
<li>School enrollments</li>
</ul><h2>The Challenge</h2>

<p>Historic documents often contain handwriting, old fonts, or other text formats that OCR software can't handle.  We need humans--from volunteers to paid staff--to read the document images and transcribe what they see into databases which can be searched, analyzed, crawled, and used by researchers.  Until now those efforts have required organizations either to outsource indexing to external partners or to cobble together their own off-line or on-site systems.  </p>

<p>Our goal is to build a tool that can be used by libraries, archives, museums, historical sites, genealogy and heritage societies to run their own indexing projects.   </p>

<h2>The Tool</h2>

<p>We're basing our online indexing tool on Scribe, a tool developed by the Citizen Science Alliance from their <a href="http://oldweather.org/">Old Weather</a> project and deployed by the Bodleian Library for <a href="http://www.whats-the-score.org/">What's the score at the Bodleian</a>.  More recently, Scribe has been customized by New York Public Library Labs for their <a href="http://ensemble.nypl.org/">Ensemble</a> database of the performing arts.</p>

<p>We're augmenting the Scribe foundation by adding a database that allows users to seamlessly search and view records created by the indexing tool and offline/legacy indexes imported via CSV files.  (This database includes a web-based search interface and APIs.)  We've also added a tool allowing administrators to upload images and associate data-entry templates with them.  Improvements to the data-entry UI and a system for reporting on indexing activity and managing volunteers will round out the effort.</p>

<p>The entire system will be released under an Apache license.  (In fact, the source code under development already is.)</p>

<h2>The Invitation</h2>

<p>We'd like to invite libraries, archives, and museums; historical, genealogy, and heritage societies to participate in the project.  Right now we need advice and examples of indexing projects that real
organizations would like to run.  This would allow us to work with an eye on real data outside the UK parish registers and English census records which have been driving our development up to the present.  It would also demonstrate a real community interest in the project.</p>

<h3>What we need from you</h3>

<p>Project definitions including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sample image files (around 5 per project), </li>
<li>A maximal spec for the data you'd like to collect,</li>
<li>A minimal acceptable set of fields you need, and</li>
<li>A description of the material and goals of the project.</li>
</ul><p>Projects can be:</p>

<ul>
<li>"Simple" documents in which one index entry corresponds
to one line of text.</li>
<li>"Complex" documents in which one entry corresponds to a more complex and lengthy set
of fields.</li>
<li>"Sparse" projects in which indexable text (e.g. personal names) may be scattered through a document of text you don't plan to transcribe.</li>
</ul><p>These images and project specs will be published online and shared among collaborators.</p>

<p>We also need</p>

<ul>
<li>Commitment that someone from your organization could weigh in on discussions about the example projects and the tool.  (I'd expect this to take around five hours per month, mostly via email.)</li>
</ul><h3>Contributing further</h3>

<p>In addition to example indexing project definitions, we need</p>

<ul>
<li>Funding to continue development.  Our top priority is building a tool for our funders' indexing projects at <a href="http://www.freereg.org.uk/">FreeREG</a> and <a href="http://www.freecen.org.uk/">FreeCEN</a>.  Building features outside of the needs common to those projects (e.g. internationalization) will require more funds.</li>
<li>Code contributions and help with design and programming.</li>
<li>Publicity and endorsement to spread the word about Open Source Indexing</li>
</ul><h2>The People</h2>

<p>Open Source Indexing is funded by FreeUKGen(a.k.a. FreeBMD), a UK-based non-profit dedicated to free access to genealogy data.  Open Source Indexing is being developed for FreeREG, which offers free indexes to UK parish registers from 1538-1837, and FreeCEN, which offers free indexes to the English and Welsh Census.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Laurie">Ben Laurie</a> is the FreeBMD trustee spearheading the effort and advising the project on Open Source and Open Data.</p>

<p>Development and database design is managed by Ben Brumfield (<a href="https://github.com/benwbrum" class="user-mention">@benwbrum</a>), an independent software engineer with eight years of experience building manuscript transcription tools.  Support for offline indexes is built by Kirk Dawson, PhD, who has volunteered with FreeREG since 1998.</p>
